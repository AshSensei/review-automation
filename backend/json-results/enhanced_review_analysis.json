    "Useability really hinges on how your hand lays on them and how easy they are for you to hit. If they are awkward to you after a week of using them, you may want to try something else. I highly recommend trying them out and also trying some other controllers.",
    "Reviews of gaming controllers are mixed, with some saying they don't work for their hand size. The software for the controllers is fine for the most part, but the onboard memory profiles don't always match up with the memory profiles on the console.",

    "The anti friction rings that are supposed to make the thumb sticks glide nice and smooth have actually done the exact opposite of what they were meant to do. After only a few hours of gameplay, the plastic on the thumbsticks do not glide smoothly at all. The thumb sticks have gouges in them from rubbing on the anti-friction rings.",

    "The Xbox Elite Series 2 gaming controller has received positive reviews from customers. The controller works great, looks cool, and is easy to swap between devices.

      "review_text": "There is a lot to say about this\n                                      controller. I go through controllers like\n                                      bear goes through honey jars... I have had\n                                      4 of these controllers so far. None of\n                                      them have had any stick drift after a year\n                                      of use. The ones I have returned were due\n                                      to some of the perceived lack of QA in the\n                                      early batches that were shipped out. In\n                                      all cases of returns it was the shoulder\n                                      buttons that would start to have issues.\n                                      My current one doesn't have any of these\n                                      issues. Issues: I have read other reviews\n                                      about the anti-friction rings on these\n                                      controllers wearing grooves into the\n                                      sticks, I have not seen this and as I said\n                                      I have had one in constant use for over a\n                                      year. The only negative I really have for\n                                      this controller is the placement of the\n                                      menu buttons. The\n                                      Menu/Start/Select/Whatever you call them\n                                      now, button on the left side of the\n                                      controller is too close to the stick. You\n                                      have to really concentrate to get your\n                                      finger around the stick to hit the button.\n                                      But that doesn't cause issues in any of\n                                      the games I play, but it may for some\n                                      people. Comfort: The controller itself is\n                                      very comfortable in the hand. It has a\n                                      slight texture to the grips that keep it\n                                      comfortably in your palm. The buttons are\n                                      all responsive, though if you are used to\n                                      Scuf you may feel that they are a bit\n                                      \"squishy\" compared to the faced buttons of\n                                      the Scuf. I tend to use my Stealth Ultra\n                                      for Shooters and even rocket league. I\n                                      also have a couple of Scuf Instinct\n                                      controllers, as well as the newer Scuf\n                                      Valor Pro Wired Controller which I also\n                                      love. The stealth ultra is a very\n                                      comfortable controller. The placement of\n                                      the back buttons works perfect for my\n                                      hands. I'll post some images of how my\n                                      hand sits on them for reference.\n                                      Performance: I tend to use my controllers\n                                      in a wired scenario, though I have used\n                                      this particular controller wireless many\n                                      times using the included dongle. I keep\n                                      the dongle in the charging cradle that\n                                      came with the controller. The only\n                                      downside to using it wireless is that\n                                      there is a delay when you want to start\n                                      your Xbox from a shot down state.\n                                      Sometimes the dongle doesn't connect for\n                                      up to a minute meaning the Xbox just sits\n                                      there until. the dongle finally connects\n                                      and sends the startup signal. Like I said,\n                                      I tend to use it wired so I don't run into\n                                      that issue. I don't notice any lag above\n                                      what I would expect from a wireless Xbox\n                                      controller when in wireless mode. The\n                                      sticks themselves have a great feel and\n                                      the built-in response curves of the sticks\n                                      just feel right to me. That is one of the\n                                      reasons I prefer this over my Scuf\n                                      controllers for games like Call of Duty.\n                                      The aim just feels better. There are\n                                      multiple curves you can choose from in the\n                                      settings. I tend to stick to the Precision\n                                      setting, and I set all my dead zones to\n                                      0%. It feels great and the aim is super\n                                      responsive. The triggers are also very\n                                      nice and the only thing I would change on\n                                      them would be to make the trigger locks\n                                      put the triggers into more of a mouse\n                                      click feel instead of the current slightly\n                                      squishier feel. There is not much travel,\n                                      but compared to the mouse click, style\n                                      trigger locks on my Scuf it just feels a\n                                      bit soft. This doesn't affect my game\n                                      play, but it is strictly a preference\n                                      thing. The placement of the rear buttons\n                                      is fine, I don't really have any pros or\n                                      cons vs. other controllers. As with any\n                                      controller the back buttons and their\n                                      useability really hinges on how your hand\n                                      lays on them and how easy they are for you\n                                      to hit, without accidently hitting them.\n                                      If they are awkward to you after a week of\n                                      using it, you may want to try something\n                                      else because if you can't feel comfortable\n                                      with your back buttons, you will not get\n                                      good muscle memory and will have to\n                                      mentally stop to think about what you are\n                                      doing when trying to hit them and that\n                                      isn't good for any controller. So I highly\n                                      recommend trying them out and also trying\n                                      out some other controllers. Back buttons\n                                      are not a deal breaker for some people,\n                                      but if you do plan to use them, make sure\n                                      you give it a good week of daily use to\n                                      really see if they work for your hand size\n                                      and shape and the way you hold your\n                                      controller. Software: The software for the\n                                      controller is fine for the most part, the\n                                      issue I tend to have is that saving the\n                                      settings back to the controller profile is\n                                      not as simple as it should be. It can be\n                                      confusing and is it feels like there were\n                                      too many steps added. As you will see in\n                                      the images, There are two menus that\n                                      represent the memory profiles in the\n                                      software and the onboard memory profiles.\n                                      They do not always match up. And you would\n                                      assume that you can just click the one you\n                                      are adjusting in the software and then\n                                      just match it up with the one you want to\n                                      save it to on the controller, but you end\n                                      up having to open another menu which makes\n                                      it even more confusing. So the software\n                                      could definitely use some more focus on\n                                      UI/UX (I may be biased as I have been a\n                                      software engineer and architect for over\n                                      25 years). The lighting is fairly straight\n                                      forward though the colors do have some\n                                      apparently duplication, and are rather\n                                      limited. I would like the option to set\n                                      custom colors for some of the effects but\n                                      most of them have pre-set color choices.\n                                      Not a deal breaker, but should be\n                                      something that is easy to add more options\n                                      too. Most of these settings can also be\n                                      done directly on the screen built into the\n                                      controller as well which is a nice bonus.\n                                      I have not used any of the app control\n                                      buttons to tie it in with phone or social\n                                      media apps, I just don't need that on my\n                                      controller. Summary: I am very happy with\n                                      this controller, and like I said I have a\n                                      lot of controllers and tend to go through\n                                      them pretty fast. I currently have 1\n                                      Stealth Ultra that I use on my personal\n                                      Xbox and PC in my office. I also have a\n                                      Scuf Valor Pro in my office for when I\n                                      just need a change. I have 3 Scuf Instinct\n                                      Pro controllers, which I do enjoy, but the\n                                      Stealth Ultra just feels better in game. I\n                                      wish it had the trigger stops of the Scuf\n                                      controllers, but that doesn't hold it back\n                                      at all. I also have a few Xbox Elite\n                                      controllers lying around, an old Razer\n                                      Wolverine Pro, and have returned most\n                                      other controllers (Nacon, Rig,\n                                      Thrustmaster, etc...) My currently main\n                                      daily drivers are the Stealth Ultra and\n                                      the Various Scuf controllers depending on\n                                      what I am playing and on which one of the\n                                      Xboxes I happen to be playing on in a\n                                      given day. We have a family of 4 who are\n                                      all Xbox and PC, so when we play together\n                                      as a family or have friends over we have\n                                      plenty of options for controllers. I\n                                      highly recommend this controller,\n                                      especially if you play FPS games and need\n                                      good aim. But like I said, test it out,\n                                      see how it feels to you. I am a BestBuy\n                                      Total Member, so I get an auto 24 month\n                                      replacement plan on everything. So no harm\n                                      in trying things out to find what works.",

Although the software\n                                      was a bit of a pain to get working, once\n                                      it was setup it seemed to be a decent\n                                      controller.

Im sure with\n                                      enough time, one can used to it. The\n                                      biggest flaw has to do with the hardware.\n                                      The anti friction rings that are supposed\n                                      to make the thumb sticks glide nice and\n                                      smooth when pushed all the way to the edge\n                                      are not soft enough and after only a few\n                                      hours of gameplay, the plastic on the\n                                      thumb stick (left one on particular) have\n                                      gouges in them from rubbing on the anti\n                                      friction rings. They have actually done\n                                      the exact opposite of what they were meant\n                                      to do. Now, because the plastic has been\n                                      scratched the thumb sticks do not glide\n                                      smoothly at all. They feel like they are\n                                      grinding when you rotate the stick. This\n                                      is obviously something they wont be able\n                                      to remedy with a software update and will\n                                      probably end up having to recall all of\n                                      the controllers they've sold until they\n                                      can get this hardware redesigned and\n                                      remade. I really wanted to love this\n                                      controller, especially for its Hall Effect\n                                      thumb sticks, but this just isnt it. I\n                                      will be returning mine and hopefully\n                                      Turtle Beach will get this figured out for\n                                      a future iteration, but for now, I would\n                                      stay away.",

The clicky buttons and hall effect\n                                      sticks were a major draw for me. I wish\n                                      someone would create a basic controller\n                                      with good sticks and clicky buttons.

The\n                                      controller feels great in my hand, and\n                                      most of the buttons are a joy to click.\n                                      However, my initial excitement was\n                                      short-lived, as I was extremely\n                                      disappointed with the following issues:\n                                      random power downs mid-use (every few\n                                      minutes), random disconnections (which\n                                      required me to repair every few minutes),\n                                      inability to pair with the mobile app\n                                      (preventing me from updating it, even\n                                      after trying on multiple devices), right\n                                      trigger with a strange click as if there\n                                      was debris stuck inside not allowing a\n                                      full click, and left stick not calibrated\n                                      properly and, even after following the\n                                      on-device recalibration, it would only\n                                      input right and down (I have a video of\n                                      this happening).

I love the location of\n                                      the buttons on the back.

I’ve been trying for years to find\n                                      the perfect controller. I really thought\n                                      this might be it. However I bought this\n                                      controller less than two weeks ago and\n                                      have maybe 50+ hrs on it. I don’t like\n                                      that not all of the buttons are\n                                      remappable. You cannot remap the start\n                                      select or capture buttons. The controller\n                                      feels lighter than other pro controllers\n                                      which is really nice. But I can tell you\n                                      that the battery life is an exaggeration.\n                                      If I leave it full power mode it lasts me\n                                      the day. However my biggest gripe is the\n                                      thumb sticks. No way to change heights and\n                                      the thumb sticks grind against the\n                                      terrible friction ring. I’m going to have\n                                      to return the controller because the\n                                      gritty grind feeling that is ruining my\n                                      game play.

This could have been a\n                                      really great control. But it’s ok as is.\n                                      The thumbsticks make the a really nice pro\n                                      controller sub par experience.
